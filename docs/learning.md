## Getting Started

The [Next.js Getting Started Guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) is a great way to bootstrap the relevant code for building a website (I used the **Automatic Setup** instructions). 

If you do end up cloning this site, I still encourage building your own from the ground up so you learn the key concepts. But if you're on a deadline, some of the early-release branches might be a good starting point to build off of.

I recommend working from scratch in a new folder, you can set up the repository afterwards you still build your version out of a clean repo and just use it as a reference. It will feel more *you* rather than being a modified clone.
