Rebuilding a site takes a lot of effort, even when you build it on top of Github Pages.

I went from a barebones HTML site to a NextJS site, but it took me months to get to a point where I felt ready to show it.

If you want to take a closer look at how it was built, consider taking a look at the [commits on the 0.1.0-react-init branch for this site](https://github.com/Rikoru/rikoru.github.io/commits/0.1.0-react-init).
