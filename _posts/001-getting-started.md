Rebuilding a site takes a lot of effort, even when you build it on top of Github Pages.
I went from a barebones HTML site to a NextJS site, but it took me months to get to a point where I felt ready to show it.
If you're curious about the process of how I rebuilt this site from the ground up, consider taking a look at the [commits on the 0.1.0-react-init branch for this site](https://github.com/Rikoru/rikoru.github.io/commits/0.1.0-react-init).

There was a point where I had decided I would include my art somehow.
At first I wanted to put it on the [About](/about) page, but it just didn't feel right.
There was too much going on and I didn't have a good reason for it.
So I got rid of it, I'll probably find a way to make a separate chunk of the site for my art and creative works.
